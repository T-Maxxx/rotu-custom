#summary Starting a Server via 'Start New Server' Menu

Since: RotU 2.2.1

= Introduction =
The files downloaded simply by playing RotU on someone's server are insufficient to properly start a RotU server.  You will need a complete version of RotU--you may download a binary release, or build svn HEAD.

Starting servers locally is buggy in RotU 2.2.1--using RotU 2.2.2 is strongly recommended.  Also, starting a server via the 'Start New Server' menu item isn't the recommended method, because it isn't the easiest method.

For information on playing RotU locally and setting up a server, see the [PlayingRotULocally Playing RotU Locally] wiki.
