// Define administrators
//
/// There is no limit to the number of admins.  Each admin, for configuration purposes,
/// is identified by an integer as in admin[i], i.e. admin1, admin2, admin3, etc.
/// For each administrator, you *MUST* specify the guid_admin[i] and at least one
/// power.  For the guid, we use the last 8 characters of the player's full guid.
/// There must not be any gaps in the admin numbering, i.e. 1,2,4,5 will fail to
/// load data for admins 4 and 5.  3,4,1,2,5 will work just fine. At least one
/// admin must be defined.
///
/// You *MUST* define at least one admin!
