//  Second-half Difficulty
//
/// After 1/2 the waves, zombie health, damage, and run speed increases by 20% to 60%
/// to make the game harder.  This factor scales those increases.  A decimal value
/// in the range 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is no increase, and 1.0 is the full hardcoded
/// increase.  Applies when surv_wave_count_system is 2.1 or 2.2

/// In regular waves, every nth zombie is a random special zombie.  Integer in the
/// range [0, 30], default is 10.

/// How many zombies in a special wave? Scales the number of zombies the wave system
/// calculates.  Float in the range [0.0, 1.0], where 0.0 is no zombies in the wave,
/// 1.0 is the same size as if it were a regular wave.  Default is 0.33, for 1/3 as
/// many zombies as a regular wave.  Does not apply to cyclops or final zombie waves.

//
// Punishment
//
/// How many demerits before the player loses 500 rank points?  Demerits are issued
